# Bicycles

I originally created this app in August 2016 as my final project for the iOS Development class in the MPCS program at the University of Chicago. The features included:
* List of bicycles and selected components of those bicycles
  - Add pictures of bicycle and the serial number
  - Purchased details of the bicycle
* Wishlist (current and history) for parts
* MapKit feature for bicycle-related businesses

I'm in the process of working on an updated version of this app (called BikeShed) that will have a fleshed-out component model for bikes and use a more robust, hierarchical storage system (Realm or SQLite depending on the direction things go in).
